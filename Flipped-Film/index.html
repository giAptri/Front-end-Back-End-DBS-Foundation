            "Flipped" is a 2010 American romantic comedy-drama film directed and
            co-written by Rob Reiner. It is based on the 2001 novel of the same
            name by Wendelin Van Draanen. Starring Callan McAuliffe, Madeline
            Carroll, and other notable actors, the film follows the evolving
            relationship between two eighth graders who gradually develop
            feelings for each other despite their differences. Initially met
            with mixed reviews and a modest box office performance, the film has
            since gained popularity as a cult favorite.

            In 1957, 7-year-old Bryce Loski moves into a new neighborhood, where
            he meets Julianna "Juli" Baker. While Juli immediately falls for
            Bryce, he finds her persistent attention overwhelming. As they grow
            older, their interactions shift, with Bryce initially avoiding Juli
            and even dating someone else to deter her.

          <p>
            However, over time, Bryce begins to understand Juli's depth and
            sincerity, especially after witnessing her emotional attachment to
            an old sycamore tree that is eventually cut down. As their
            eighth-grade year progresses, Bryce starts to develop genuine
            feelings for Juli. The story culminates with Bryce planting a new
            sycamore tree as a symbol of his feelings, leading to a moment of
            mutual understanding between the two.

          <h2>Their Families</h2>
          <p>
            Family dynamics play a crucial role in "Flipped." While Juli comes
            from a warm and supportive household, Bryce slowly discovers the
            flaws within his own family, particularly in his father’s judgmental
            and envious nature.

              Juli's family is loving and encouraging, fostering a positive

              Bryce's father, in contrast, is resentful and critical of others,
              projecting his insecurities onto his son. As Bryce matures, he
              begins to see the toxicity in his father’s behavior, leading him
              to reevaluate his perspective.
